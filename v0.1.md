- Get real time price for exchanging rate or stock, even cryptocurrency;
- Simple transaction syntax;

## Commands

The 'command' is the first word/symbol of the texts (exclude date). Some commands are same with 'directives' in Beancount.

| Command                 | Description                                                  |

## General Rules

To make the syntax easier, users will be asked to add the following fileds to config:

- Output format, this version only support Beancount;
- Users' timezone;
- Default currency code;
- Indent length and line length;
- Text replacements for account names;



Costflow Syntax v0.1 Rules:

- The date is optional. If no YYYY-MM-DD format date found, the date will be 'today' in your timezone. Use '2019-07-01' in the following examples;

- Commodity/Currency code is optional, too, the default value is what you set before. Use 'USD' in following examples;

- Metadata is not supported in v0.1;

- Inline comment is not supported in v0.1;

- Commodity/Currency should be a word all in capital letters;

- The abbreviation of an account name should **not** be a word all in capital letters or numbers; These  replacements might be used in the following examples.

  ```javascript
  eob: Equity:Opening-Balances
  bofa: Assets:US:BofA:Checking
  rx: Assets:Receivables:X
  ry: Assets:Receivables:Y
  boc: Assets:CN:BOC
  cmb: Liabilities:CreditCard:CMB
  food: Expenses:Food
  phone: Expenses:Home:Phone
  rent: Expenses:Home:Rent
  ```

  

##  Transaction

Transactions are the most common type of directives that occur in a ledger. Costflow Syntax support two methods for transactions.

### First: >

The first one uses greater-than sign, it means the flow direction from its left to its right. The general format is:

```javascript
[YYYY-MM-DD] [Flag] ["Payee"] ["Narration"] [#tag] [^link] AMOUNT [COMMODITY] FROM_ACCOUNT > [AMOUNT] [COMMODITY] TO_ACCOUNT
```

The elements in square brackets are optional. Rules details:

- The date is optional. If no YYYY-MM-DD format date found, the date will be 'today' in your timezone;

- The flag is used to indicate the status of a transaction, * means completed transaction, ! means incomplete transaction. * can be omitted;

- Payess and Narration are easy to use, but the syntax is a little bit complex:
  - Compatible with Beancount double quotes format: if there is only one double-quotes string, it is a narration; If there are two double-quotes strings, the first one is a payee and the second one is narration. Not support the legacy pipe symbol format;
  - Double-quotes can be omitted in these cases:
    - Input narration directly without double-quotes, but the narration **cannot** contain numbers. E.g., 'Xbox 360 Game' is not a valid narration;
    - Payee can be used in @Payee format. In this rule, payee **cannot** contain blank spaces, but payee can be connected with - or _. E.g., @KFC and @Burger_King are all valid payees;
    - If you only want to record payee, just input @Payee, no need to concern narration;
  - Tag: strings start with # are treated as tags;
  - Link: strings start with ^ are treated as links;
  - In the first transaction syntax, the order of AMOUNT / COMMODITY / ACCOUNT should be:
    1. AMOUNT. Because > means the flow direction, so the default amounts in left side are negative, the minus sign can be omitted;
    2. COMMODITY. Optional, the default value is what you set before;
    3. ACCOUNT. Accounts can be the full name in your ledger file, or they can be the abbreviations you set before.
  - The right side rules are the same with the left side, except the default amounts are positive;
  - [Costs and prices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAMVrKIA2qtRGmoVDSUBJGmYZSygUaR0uOMW1GV3YE0/edit#heading=h.mtqrwt24wnzs) are same with Beancount;
  - If there are multiple accounts in either side, use + to connect, Be aware, only one > allowed in a message;
  - The amounts in the right side can be omitted, they are equal to **sum*(left side amounts)/(right side accounts number)**. Useful when splitting expenses with friends.
  
  
  
  Examples, finally!

  ```
  
  

### Second: |

The second method uses the pipe sign (U+007C) instead of >, it means "start a new line", the timing is the same with Beancount. The syntax detail:

```javascript
[YYYY-MM-DD] [Flag] ["Payee"] ["Narration"] [#tag] [^link] | ACCOUNT_A [COMMODITY] AMOUNT | ACCOUNT_B [COMMODITY] AMOUNT
```

As we can see, the usage of Date, Flag, Payee, Narration, Tag, Link are all same with the first one. The differences:

- Should insert a | before each account;
- The order of ACCOUNT / COMMODITY / AMOUNT is different from the first one but same with Beancount;
- The second transaction syntax has no flow direction, so the minus sign and amounts cannot be omitted;

We can rewrite the examples with |:

```javascript
// #1 Traditional format with |
2017-01-05 "RiverBank Properties" "Paying the rent" | Assets:US:BofA:Checking -2400 | Expenses:Home:Rent 2400

## <a name="comment"></a>Comment

; and // are easy to use as comments, just type anything after them. 

Examples:

```javascript
; I paid and left the taxi, forgot to take change, it was cold.
// to do: cancel Netflix subscription
```

The difference is that comments with ; will be saved to Costflow first, then appended to the ledger file, comments with // will only be saved to Costflow. // is useful for reminding yourself to do some financial actions.



## <a name="open"></a>Open

Same with Beancount. Do not support metadata in this version.

```javascript
[YYYY-MM-DD] open ACCOUNT
```



Examples:

```javascript
// Input

// Output
2019-07-01 open Assets:US:BofA
```



## <a name="close"></a>Close

```



## <a name="option"></a>Option

Syntax:

```javascript

```



Explanation:

NAME and VALUE usually are double-quotes strings, but in the following cases double-quotes can be omitted:

- If NAME is "title", just input option VALUE, VALUE does not need double-quotes;
- If VALUE is one of currency codes in [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), the NAME can be omitted (will be parsed to operating_currency), VALUE does not need double-quotes;



Examples:

```javascript
// Input
option Example Costflow file
// Output
option "title" "Example Costflow file"

// Input
option CNY
// Output
option "operating_currency" "CNY"

// Input
option "conversion_currency" "NOTHING"
// Output
option "conversion_currency" "NOTHING"

```



## <a name="note"></a>Note

Syntax:

```javascript
[YYYY-MM-DD] note ACCOUNT DESCRIPTION
```



Explanation:

- ACCOUNT can be the full name in your ledger file, or they can be the abbreviations you set before;
- DESCRIPTION can be any strings, no need double-quotes.

```



## <a name="balance"></a>Balance

Syntax:

[YYYY-MM-DD] balance ACCOUNT AMOUNT [COMMODITY]
```



Explanation:

- ACCOUNT can be the full name in your ledger file, or they can be the abbreviations you set before;
- COMMODITY  is optional, the default value is what you set before;



Examples:

```javascript
// Input
balance bofa 360

```



## <a name="pad"></a>Pad

Syntax:

[YYYY-MM-DD] pad ACCOUNT ACCOUNT_PAD
```



Explanation:

- ACCOUNT and ACCOUNT_PAD can be the full name in your ledger file, or they can be the abbreviations you set before;
- Use pad carefully. Check [Beancount docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAMVrKIA2qtRGmoVDSUBJGmYZSygUaR0uOMW1GV3YE0/edit#heading=h.aw8ic3d8k8rq).



Examples:

```javascript

```



## <a name="price"></a>Price

Syntax:

```javascript
[YYYY-MM-DD] price COMMODITY_A [PRICE] [COMMODITY_B]
```



Explanation:

- COMMODITY_B  is optional, the default value is what you set before;
- Set the PRICE manually: just use a number as PRICE like Beancount;
- If there is no PRICE found, Costflow will automatically get the latest exchange rates of currencies, or the latest price of cryptocurrencies and stock (by Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). The priority:
  1. Firstly, Costflow will check whether COMMODITY_A is one of [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)  currency codes. If it is, get the exchange rate;
  2. Secondly, Costflow will check whether COMMODITY_A is one of cryptocurrency codes that Alpha Vantage support ([support list](https://www.alphavantage.co/digital_currency_list/)). If it is, get the cryptocurrency price;
  3. Finally, Costflow will treat COMMODITY_A as a stock code and get its price. Only stocks listed on NASDAQ and NYSE are supported in this version. Note, COMMODITY_B **should not** be set, if COMMODITY_A is a stock code, COMMODITY_B is inherited from the stock market. 



Examples:

```javascript
// #1 Input
2017-01-17 price USD 1.08 CAD
// #1 Output
2017-01-17 price USD 1.08 CAD

// #2 Input, get the exchange rate automatically. The word "to" is only for understanding, can be omitted.
price CAD to USD
// #2 Output
2019-07-01 price 

// #3 Input, get Bitcoin price
price BTC
// #3 Output
2019-07-01 price BTC 11946.64 USD

// #4 Input, get Apple stock price
price AAPL
// #4 Output
2019-07-01 price AAPL 199.8 USD

```



## <a name="calculate"></a>$

$ is for getting the latest exchange rate of currencies or the latest price of cryptocurrencies and stocks. The result will be returned directly, **will not** be saved to the ledger file. The syntax:

```javascript
$ [AMOUNT] COMMODITY_A [to] COMMODITY_B
```



Explanation:

- COMMODITY_B  is optional, the default value is what you set before;
- AMOUNT is optional, the default amount is 1;
- The word "to" is only for understanding, can be omitted;
- The priority is the same with Price:
  1. Firstly, Costflow will check whether COMMODITY_A is one of [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)  currency codes. If it is, get the exchange rate;
  2. Secondly, Costflow will check whether COMMODITY_A is one of cryptocurrency codes that Alpha Vantage support ([support list](https://www.alphavantage.co/digital_currency_list/)). If it is, get the cryptocurrency price;
  3. Finally, Costflow will treat COMMODITY_A as a stock code and get its price. Only stocks listed on NASDAQ and NYSE are supported in this version. Note, COMMODITY_B **should not** be set, if COMMODITY_A is a stock code, COMMODITY_B is inherited from the stock market. 



Examples:

```javascript
// Input, get the exchange rate automatically. The word "to" is only for understanding, can be omitted.
$ CAD to USD
// Return
1 CAD = 0.7637 USD

// Input, get 10 Bitcoin price
$ 10 BTC
// Return
10 BTC = 119466.4 USD

// Input, get Apple stock price
$ AAPL
// Return
AAPL 199.8 USD (-0.030%)

```



## <a name="event"></a>Event

Syntax:

```javascript
[YYYY-MM-DD] event NAME VALUE
```



Explanation:

- NAME and VALUE can use double-quotes like Beancount;
- If no double-quotes found, the first word (exclude date) will be saved as NAME, the rest part will be saved as VALUE;



Examples:

```javascript
// Input, traditional Beancount format
2017-01-02 event "location" "Paris, France"
// Output
2017-01-02 event "location" "Paris, France"

// Input, without double-quotes
event location Paris, France
// Output
2017-01-02 event "location" "Paris, France"
```
