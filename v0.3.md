# Costflow Syntax v0.3

[Costflow](https://www.costflow.io/) is a productivity tool for plain text accounting. By connecting messaging apps with cloud storage services, it can be much easier to create new directives/entries, especially on mobile devices. You can get more details in [this post](https://blog.costflow.io/introducing-costflow/).

Costflow Syntax is the rule for parsing plain text to the accounting tools formats, such as Beancount, Ledger and hledger, etc.

You can try Costflow Syntax on [Costflow Playground](https://playground.costflow.io/) while you are reading. All products that support Costflow Syntax are listed on [Docs homepage](https://docs.costflow.io/).

## Features

- Date is optional, the default value is 'today' in your timezone.
- Currency/Commodity code is optional.
- Account name replacements. E.g. bofa in your message will be replaced with Assets:US:BofA:Checking.
- Get real time price for exchanging rate or stock, even cryptocurrency.
- Simple transaction syntax.
- Custom indent and line length.
- Added in v0.2: Insert links.
- Added in v0.2: Add time info to transactions.
- Added in v0.2: Simpler date format.
- Added in v0.3: [Formula](#formula), make creating transactions with patterns easier, for sure.

All belowing contents are based on Costflow Syntax v0.3 and Beancount is the output format supoorted.

## Commands

The 'command' is the first word/symbol of the texts (exclude date). Some commands are same with 'directives' in Beancount.

| Command                 | Description                                                  |

## Config

To make the syntax easier, users will be asked to fill the following fileds to config:

| Config       | Required | Type   | Detail                                                       | Example          |

### General Rules:

- The date is optional. If no YYYY-MM-DD format date found, the date will be 'today' in your timezone. Use '2019-07-01' in the following examples. Start from v0.2, we support more date formats:
  - Month name: Jul 25 / July 10 / Aug 2. The month name can be full name or three-letter abbreviations, the first letter should be uppercase.
  - Relative dates:
    - Yesterday: `yesterday` / `ytd`
    - The day before yesterday: `dby`
    - Tomorrow: `tomorrow` / `tmr`, useful for Balance command.
    - The day after tomorrow: `dat`

- Commodity/Currency code is optional, too, the default value is what you set before. Use 'USD' in following examples.

- Metadata is not supported in this version.

- Inline comment is not supported in this version.

- Commodity/Currency should be a word all in capital letters.

- The abbreviation of an account name should **not** be a word all in capital letters or numbers.

- If the transaction is `2019-07-01 *  "McDonald's" "🍔"`, and the insertTime is `metadata`, the time info will be applied like:
  ```
  2019-07-01 *  "McDonald's" "🍔"
    time: "11:22:33"
    ...

Here is the config will be used in following examples.

```json

    "mode": "beancount",
    "currency": "CNY",
    "timezone": "Asia/Hong_Kong",
    "tag": "#costflow",

        "spotify": "@Spotify 15.98 USD visa > subscription"
    }
}
```


##  Transaction

Transactions are the most common type of directives that occur in a ledger. Costflow Syntax support two methods for transactions.

### First: >

The first one uses greater-than sign, it means the flow direction from its left to its right. The general format is:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] [Flag] ["Payee"] ["Narration"] [#tag] [^link] AMOUNT [COMMODITY] FROM_ACCOUNT > [AMOUNT] [COMMODITY] TO_ACCOUNT
```

The elements in square brackets are optional. Rules details:

- The date is optional. If no YYYY-MM-DD format date found, the date will be 'today' in your timezone;

- The flag is used to indicate the status of a transaction, * means completed transaction, ! means incomplete transaction. * can be omitted;

- Payess and Narration are easy to use, but the syntax is a little bit complex:
  - Compatible with Beancount double quotes format: if there is only one double-quotes string, it is a narration; If there are two double-quotes strings, the first one is a payee and the second one is narration. Not support the legacy pipe symbol format;
  - Double-quotes can be omitted in these cases:
    - Input narration directly without double-quotes, but the narration **cannot** contain numbers. E.g., 'Xbox 360 Game' is not a valid narration;
    - Payee can be used in @Payee format. In this rule, payee **cannot** contain blank spaces, but payee can be connected with - or _. E.g., @KFC and @Burger_King are all valid payees;
    - If you only want to record payee, just input @Payee, no need to concern narration;
  - Tag: strings start with # are treated as tags;
  - Link: strings start with ^ are treated as links;
  - In the first transaction syntax, the order of AMOUNT / COMMODITY / ACCOUNT should be:
    1. AMOUNT. Because > means the flow direction, so the default amounts in left side are negative, the minus sign can be omitted;
    2. COMMODITY. Optional, the default value is what you set before;
    3. ACCOUNT. Accounts can be the full name in your ledger file, or they can be the abbreviations you set before.
  - The right side rules are the same with the left side, except the default amounts are positive;
  - [Costs and prices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAMVrKIA2qtRGmoVDSUBJGmYZSygUaR0uOMW1GV3YE0/edit#heading=h.mtqrwt24wnzs) are same with Beancount;
  - If there are multiple accounts in either side, use + to connect, Be aware, only one > allowed in a message;
  - The amounts in the right side can be omitted, they are equal to **sum*(left side amounts)/(right side accounts number)**. Useful when splitting expenses with friends.

  ```
  
  

### Second: |

The second method uses the pipe sign (U+007C) instead of >, it means "start a new line", the timing is the same with Beancount. The syntax detail:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] [Flag] ["Payee"] ["Narration"] [#tag] [^link] | ACCOUNT_A [COMMODITY] AMOUNT | ACCOUNT_B [COMMODITY] AMOUNT
```

As we can see, the usage of Date, Flag, Payee, Narration, Tag, Link are all same with the first one. The differences:

- Should insert a | before each account;
- The order of ACCOUNT / COMMODITY / AMOUNT is different from the first one but same with Beancount;
- The second transaction syntax has no flow direction, so the minus sign and amounts cannot be omitted;

We can rewrite the examples with |:

```
// #1 Traditional format with |

## <a name="formula"></a>Formula

Added in v0.3. Formula is for making creating transactions with patterns easier, such as Netflix and Spotify subscriptions,  Uber and Lyft bills, even salaries.

Like replacement, a config is needed before start using formula. The formula config is `key: value` format. The key is the formula name (can't be a command name), the value is the content to parse with Costflow Syntax. Some variables are allowed in the value. The variable should be wrapped in double curly braces `{{ }}`. The variables allowed in current version:

- amount: the first number in the input. You can use some basic math operations with the amount, e.g. `amount * 0.8`;
- pre: the original input excludes the formula name;

More variables will be supported in future versions.

The way formula works is: convert the formula based on its config, then parse the value with Costflow Syntax all over again. So the value should follow Costflow Syntax too.

For example, we wrote a formula config for AWS transaction:

```json
{
  "aws": "@AWS {{ amount }} USD visa > cloud"
}
```

If we run `f aws 60` or just `aws 60` in Costflow Hub / CLI / Playground, the formula will run like this:

![Formula flowchart](/img/formula-example-1.png)

Formula is created for transactions, but it can be used for other directives. Here are some example formula config:

```json
{
  "formula": {
    "aws": "@AWS {{ amount }} USD visa > aws",
    "cashback": "Airline Cash Back {{ amount }} visa > {{ amount * 0.95 }} expenseFlight + {{ amount * 0.05 }} incomeCashback",
    "netflix": "@Netflix 15.99 USD visa > netflix",
    "split": "Dinner {{ amount }} visa > food + rx + ry",
    "spotify": "@Spotify 14.99 USD visa > spotify",
    "uber": "@Uber {{ amount }} USD visa > uber",
    "rent": "Rent {{ amount }} USD visa > rent",
    "v2f": "{{ pre }} visa > food",
    "☕️": "@Leplays ☕️ {{ amount }}  Liabilities:CreditCard:Visa > Expenses:Coffee"
  }
}
```



## <a name="comment"></a>Comment

; and // are easy to use as comments, just type anything after them. 

Examples:

```
; I paid and left the taxi, forgot to take change, it was cold.
// to do: cancel Netflix subscription
```

The difference is that comments with ; will be saved to Costflow first, then appended to the ledger file, comments with // will only be saved to Costflow. // is useful for reminding yourself to do some financial actions.



## <a name="open"></a>Open

Same with Beancount. Do not support metadata in this version.

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] open ACCOUNT
```



Examples:

```
// Input
open Assets:US:BofA
// Output
2019-07-01 open Assets:US:BofA
```



## <a name="close"></a>Close

Same with Beancount.

```
// Input
close Assets:US:BofA
// Output
2019-07-01 close Assets:US:BofA
```



## <a name="commodity"></a>Commodity

Same with Beancount. Do not support metadata in this version.

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] commodity SYMBOL
```



Examples:

```
// Input
commodity BTC
// Output
2019-07-01 commodity BTC
```



## <a name="option"></a>Option

Syntax:

```
option [NAME] VALUE
```



Explanation:

NAME and VALUE usually are double-quotes strings, but in the following cases double-quotes can be omitted:

- If NAME is "title", just input option VALUE, VALUE does not need double-quotes;
- If VALUE is one of currency codes in [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), the NAME can be omitted (will be parsed to operating_currency), VALUE does not need double-quotes;



Examples:

```
// Input
option Example Costflow file
// Output
option "title" "Example Costflow file"

// Input
option CNY
// Output
option "operating_currency" "CNY"

// Input
option "conversion_currency" "NOTHING"
// Output
option "conversion_currency" "NOTHING"

```



## <a name="note"></a>Note

Syntax:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] note ACCOUNT DESCRIPTION
```



Explanation:

- ACCOUNT can be the full name in your ledger file, or they can be the abbreviations you set before;
- DESCRIPTION can be any strings, no need double-quotes.



Examples

```
// Input
note bofa Called about fraudulent card.
// Output
2019-07-01 note Assets:US:BofA:Checking "Called about fraudulent card."
```



## <a name="balance"></a>Balance

Syntax:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] balance ACCOUNT AMOUNT [COMMODITY]
```



Explanation:

- ACCOUNT can be the full name in your ledger file, or they can be the abbreviations you set before;
- COMMODITY  is optional, the default value is what you set before;



Examples:

```
// Input
balance bofa 360
// Output
2019-07-01 balance Assets:US:BofA:Checking 360 USD

// Input with simpler date format. Because Beancount applies the time of all non-transaction directives at the beginning of its date, we usually use the next day for this directive. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAMVrKIA2qtRGmoVDSUBJGmYZSygUaR0uOMW1GV3YE0/edit#heading=h.l0pvgeniwvq8
tmr balance bofa 360
// Output
2019-07-02 balance Assets:US:BofA:Checking 360 USD
```



## <a name="pad"></a>Pad

Syntax:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] pad ACCOUNT ACCOUNT_PAD
```



Explanation:

- ACCOUNT and ACCOUNT_PAD can be the full name in your ledger file, or they can be the abbreviations you set before;
- Use pad carefully. Check [Beancount docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAMVrKIA2qtRGmoVDSUBJGmYZSygUaR0uOMW1GV3YE0/edit#heading=h.aw8ic3d8k8rq).



Examples:

```
// Input
pad bofa eob
// Output
2019-07-01 pad Assets:US:BofA:Checking Equity:Opening-Balances
```



## <a name="price"></a>Price

Syntax:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD] price COMMODITY_A [PRICE] [COMMODITY_B]
```



Explanation:

- COMMODITY_B  is optional, the default value is what you set before;
- Set the PRICE manually: just use a number as PRICE like Beancount;
- If there is no PRICE found, Costflow will automatically get the latest exchange rates of currencies, or the latest price of cryptocurrencies and stock (by Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). The priority:
  1. Firstly, Costflow will check whether COMMODITY_A is one of [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)  currency codes. If it is, get the exchange rate;
  2. Secondly, Costflow will check whether COMMODITY_A is one of cryptocurrency codes that Alpha Vantage support ([support list](https://www.alphavantage.co/digital_currency_list/)). If it is, get the cryptocurrency price;
